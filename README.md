# SocialSwap
Hackathon da Polygon 28/04/2023




The difficulty in proving the impact data of social projects and tracking financial transfers are challenges faced by organizations working with social development. The lack of transparency in the process of resource transfer and the difficulty in accurately measuring the results obtained hinder decision-making and can lead to the waste of resources.

We propose to use data auditing through identifiers and zero-knowledge proofs to make the process more transparent and reliable, allowing greater control over the use of resources and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of projects.

Our proposal is to issue carbon credits captured from environmental reserves controlled by governments and renewable energy-producing communities, and with the sale of these credits, support projects and initiatives that promote the development of peripheral zones present in urban centers and remote areas of the country that have low levels of infrastructure, sanitation, access to quality food, income, employment, housing, education, and security.

A proposed solution by the Trusting Network platform to address this issue is the issuance of carbon credits captured from government-controlled environmental reserves. These credits can be used to support projects and initiatives that promote the improvement of infrastructure, sanitation, access to quality food, income, employment, housing, education, and security in peripheral regions of the country. To ensure the transparency and reliability of impact data generated by projects funded by carbon credits, we propose the implementation of a network authentication and validation system, which involves the creation of a digital platform that allows the registration and monitoring of projects funded by carbon credits, as well as the verification of impact data generated through multiple identity validations of agents and data sources using a zero-knowledge proof SSI system. This can promote transparency and reliability in the carbon credit market, while meeting carbon emission reduction targets and contributing to sustainable development and the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in Brazil. In addition, the use of carbon credits can incentivize the preservation of green areas and the conservation of biodiversity, contributing to the fight against climate change and the preservation of the country's natural heritage.
